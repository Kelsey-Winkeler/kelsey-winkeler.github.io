Thanks for visiting my website!
---

I am a graduate student researcher in [Brooks Casas](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/people-directory/primary-faculty/casas.html) and [Pearl Chiu](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/people-directory/primary-faculty/chiu.html)'s labs in the [Computational Psychiatry Unit](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/research/research-centers/center-for-human-neuroscience/computational-psychiatry-unit.html) at [Fralin Biomedical Research Institute of Virginia Tech Carillion](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/). 

Our labs are at the intersection of computer science, neuroscience, clinical psychology, and economics; we design studies that investigate social interactions, psychopathology, and response to treatment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and microeconomic games. A great open access recent example of our lab's work is this paper on [reinforcement learning in depression.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2782452)

If you want to get in touch, feel free to contact me using the links in the sidebar, or [set up a meeting.](https://calendly.com/kwinkeler/30min)

Talks

My research focuses on interpersonal interactions in Veterans with PTSD, using economic games and fMRI, and while I haven't published on it (yet), you can learn a little about it under the [Talks](https://kelsey-winkeler.github.io/talks/) tab. 

Publications

Before my PhD, I collaborated on a few interesting studies involving various combiations of plants, genetics, and volatile metablomics, which you can read about in my [Publications](https://kelsey-winkeler.github.io/publications/) tab.

Clinical Portfolio
---
I am also a clinical psychology PhD student in the [Department of Psychology at Virginia Tech](), and provide services as a graduate student clinician at the [Psychological Services Center](https://support.psyc.vt.edu/centers/psc). Generally, I am a CBT-trained graduate clinician supervised by PhD-level licensed clinical psychologists, and emphasize creating a safe and supportive environment, especially for sexuality-and-gender minoritized people. I have specialized in treatment of child and adolescent ADHD as well as trauma, anxiety and mood disorders. I additionally regularly perform adult and child autism and ADHD assessments. For more information about the services Virginia Tech offers, check out the [Clinical Portfolio](https://kelsey-winkeler.github.io/portfolio/) tab.

Teaching
---
Previously, I was an [AmeriCorps](https://americorps.gov/serve) member and a middle and high school science teacher, and I care deeply about equitable and accessible primary, secondary, and post-secondary education. You can read about my teaching experience under "Teaching". 

In my free time, I also still provide mentoring and outreach to undergraduates at my alma mater, the College of Wooster, via the [Fighting Scots Career Connections](https://wooster.firsthand.co/) website, as well as a handful of high school students. If you're not a Wooster alum and would like advice about grad school, being a first-generation college student, or anything else, feel free to send me an email or schedule a Zoom meeting on my [Google Calendar](https://calendar.app.google/MurUNvZRmf8KUbzp7) and we can chat.
