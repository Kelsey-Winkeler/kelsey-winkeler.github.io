Over the course of my first and second years at Virginia Tech, I provided services as a graduate student clinician at the [Psychological Services Center](https://support.psyc.vt.edu/centers/psc) and the [Child Assessment Center](https://childstudycenter.wixsite.com/childstudycenter). I was supervised by two PhD-level licensed clinical psychologists that use an eclectic approach to therapy, with particular focus on structural family therapy and person-centered approaches.

I completed comprehensive assessments for neurodevelopmental disorders, learning disorders, and complex psychopathology in both adults and children. 

At the PSC, we offer assessments for teenagers 17+ and adults, and specialize in adult ADHD and autism assessments.
