In September of 2024, I began a fourth year practicum at the Psychological Services Center at Virginia Tech, under the supervision of Dr. Chloe Hudson. I supervised one second year student, and additionally ran two DBT-A groups: one for parents, and one for teenagers. My practicum will end in May of 2024.
