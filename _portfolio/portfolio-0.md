In September of 2024, I began a fourth year practicum at the Psychological Services Center at Virginia Tech, under the supervision of Dr. Chloe Hudson. I completed dialectical behavior therapy with one adolescent and their family, including single-family skills training, individual therapy, and phone coaching. I completed one child assessment, and completed training in the ADOS-2. I also supervised two second year students individually (one for DBT skills training, and one for parent-child interaction therapy) and helped with group supervision. I also provided consultation for parent-child interaction therapy and dialectical behavior therapy skills and techniques in individual DBT (i.e. chain analysis) as needed. I completed this practicum in September 2025.
