In February of 2024, I began an externship at [Carilion Children's Pediatric Behavioral Medicine](https://www.carilionclinic.org/locations/carilion-childrens-pediatric-behavioral-medicine), a department of [Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital](https://www.carilionclinic.org/locations/carilion-roanoke-memorial-hospital). I completed the training process to become certified in [Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)](https://www.pcit.org/) under [Dr. Tara Mitchell](https://www.carilionclinic.org/providers/tara-mitchell-phd), who has been practicing PCIT for 17 years and is currently a certified in-agency trainer. I continue to saw up to 6 PCIT clients per week at Carilion Children's under Dr. Mitchell's supervision. I also helped Dr. Mitchell train two externs and one masters-level counseling resident in PCIT by providing didactics, performing co-therapy, and helping with skills practice.

In addition to PCIT, I saw families and individual clients between the ages of 9 and 18 with health comorbidities under the supervision of Dr. Lori Dudley. Modalities included exposure therapy for specific phobia, CBT for Diabetes, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), CBT for generalized anxiety, Parent Management Training (PMT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy skills training (DBT), and Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C). 

I also co-lead two summer social skills groups with [Victoria Rosenberg, LPC](https://www.carilionclinic.org/providers/victoria-r-rosenberg-lpc), and am part of a consultation team that included RN, LCSW, LPC, and LCP practicioners. I performed consultation with LCSWs and LPCs for exposure therapy (particularly exposure and response prevention). 

I completed three assessments for diagnostic clarification related to autism spectrum disorder and administered Module 3 and Module 4 of the ADOS-2. 

I completed my externship in October 2025.
