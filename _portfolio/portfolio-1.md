I am a third year clinical psychology PhD student in the [Department of Psychology at Virginia Tech](https://psyc.vt.edu/). Over the course of my first and second years at Virginia Tech, I provided services as a graduate student clinician at the [Psychological Services Center](https://support.psyc.vt.edu/centers/psc) and the [Child Assessment Center](https://childstudycenter.wixsite.com/childstudycenter). My therapy training orientation is CBT, but I was supervised by two PhD-level licensed clinical psychologists that use an eclectic approach to therapy, so I have experience in multiple manuals and unmanualized CBT, DBT skills, couples and family therapy, and CPT as well as integrating person-centered, humanistic, and mindfullness-based approaches. Regardless of main treatment modality, I emphasize client therapeutic alliance, and strive to maintain a safe, supportive, and culturally responsive approach-- especially for people that are racial and ethnic minorities in the New River Valley region and sexuality-and-gender minoritized people. I have some experience with adults, but specialize in treatment of child and adolescent ADHD and comorbid trauma, anxiety and mood disorders. 

I additionally regularly perform comprehensive assessments for autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and other psychopathology in both adults and children-- with a focus on identifying current areas of distress and interference in my client's life and the intention to identify resources and treatment methods that will help reduce these difficulties. In addition to assisting other clinicians and labs with assessments, I have completed 8 full-batteries and integrative reports.

At the PSC, we offer assessments for teenagers 17+ and adults, and specialize in adult ADHD and autism assessments.
