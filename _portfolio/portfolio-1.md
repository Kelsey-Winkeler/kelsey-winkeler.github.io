In February of 2024, I began an externship at [Carilion Children's Pediatric Behavioral Medicine](https://www.carilionclinic.org/locations/carilion-childrens-pediatric-behavioral-medicine), a department of [Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital](https://www.carilionclinic.org/locations/carilion-roanoke-memorial-hospital). I completed the training process to become certified in [Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)](https://www.pcit.org/) under [Dr. Tara Mitchell](https://www.carilionclinic.org/providers/tara-mitchell-phd), who has been practicing PCIT for 16 years. I continue to see up to 6 PCIT clients per week at Carilion Children's under Dr. Mitchell's supervision. In addition to PCIT, I see families and individual clients between the ages of 2 and 18, and have used methods including Parent Management Training (PMT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy skills training (DBT), and Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C). I also co-lead two summer social skills groups with [Victoria Rosenberg, LPC](https://www.carilionclinic.org/providers/victoria-r-rosenberg-lpc), and was part of a consultation team that included RN, LCSW, LPC, and LCP practicioners.
