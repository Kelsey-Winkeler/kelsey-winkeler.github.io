I am a third year clinical psychology PhD student in the [Department of Psychology at Virginia Tech](https://psyc.vt.edu/). Currently I am on a summer externship at the [Boston Child Study Center in Portland, Maine](https://bostonchildstudycentermaine.com/), helping [Dr. Michael Hollander](https://bostonchildstudycentermaine.com/michael-hollander) with running adolescent DBT groups.
