In 2023, I performed a summer externship at the [Boston Child Study Center in Portland, Maine](https://bostonchildstudycentermaine.com/), helping [Dr. Michael Hollander](https://bostonchildstudycentermaine.com/michael-hollander) with running adolescent DBT groups. I also was part of a multidisciplinary consultation team that included other clinical and counseling psychologists, licensed professional counselors, clinical social workers, executive functioning and academic coaches, a psychiatrist and a nurse practitioner. Outside of learning about DBT and PCIT as modalities, this was my favorite part of my work with BCSC-- providing comprehensive outpatient support to adolescents and families that needed it.
